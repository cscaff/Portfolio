# Hi!

My name is Christian, and I am Master's student at Columbia University, studying Computer Science. My focus up until now has been in applying **programming language theory** in software development.

I spent two semesters at the [**GATAS Laboratory**](https://gataslab.org) at the University of Florida as an undergraduate research programmer where I developed domain specific languages for [AlgebraicJulia](https://www.algebraicjulia.org), an open source software suite dedicated to applying category theory to scientific computing.

In the summer of 2025, I was a research intern at the [Georgia Tech Research Institute's](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu) Advanced Research in Computing and Artificial Intelligence Division [(**ARCAID**)](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/focus-areas/advanced-research-computing-and-artificial-intelligence) where I developed Wyvern Graph, a python-based tool for translating LLVM IR programs into knowledge graphs to better understand how neuro-symbolic AI can be applied in program analysis.

I also love to teach! I spent two semesters as a teaching assistant at the University of Florida for COP 4020: Programming Language Concepts where I taught students how to apply programming language theory in developing their own compiler frontend.
